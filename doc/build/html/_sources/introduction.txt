Introduction
=============

SEING streamlines the process of computing fingerprints of molecular systems with a focus on those
that explicitly encode spatial coordinates.

Fingerprints (in this context) are numerical representations of chemical structures
designed to be invariant under property-perseving operations such as permutation of atoms of the
same nature, geometric rotation, etc. 

Inspired by similar representations in chemi-informatics, those structural representations were created as 
alternatives to cartesian coordinates which are not suitable for machine learning studies. The hope 
is that those fingerprints will open the door for new strucutre-property explorations and the development 
of improved predictive capability in materials science.

SEING (old French word for "signature") is created and released to the community as a vehicle to
streamline and facilitate the use of those fingerprints in ML applications in the hope of 
accelerating the use of AI in materials science applications for better understanding
and easier discovery of a wide range of new materials.
