INTRODUCTION
=============

SEING is a C/C++ free and open-source package created in the Clancy Group at Cornell University to
 calculate molecular fingerprints suitable for machine learning applications.

Fingerprints (in this context) are numerical representations of chemical environments and structures
 designed to be invariant under property-perseving operations such as permutation of atoms of the
 same nature, geometric rotation, etc. 

"Within the framework of structure-property relationships, the atomic structure of a material is the
 quintessential determinant of its properties and suitability for specific applications. As a result,
 the design of materials usually involves creating a realistic understanding of underlying atomic-scale
 structures, acquired using quantum or classical calculations. An exciting and relatively recent 
development in computational material design is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
 learning (ML) techniques to accelerate the analysis, design, and discovery of “structural signatures” 
that impact their properties. However, in order to be predictive, a key requirement for this new
 progression has been the availability of numerical representations of atomic structures that are 
invariant under all property-preserving operations, such as geometric translations and rotations. 
Although this requirement has proven more elusive than anticipated, significant progress has been 
accomplished over the past decade or so, with proposed representations accomplishing various degrees
 of performance." [See official publication for more details]

SEING (old French word for "signature") is created and released to the community as a vehicle to
 streamline and facilitate the use of those fingerprints in ML applications in the hope of 
accelerating the use of AI in materials science applications for better understanding
 and easier discovery of a wide range of new materials.
