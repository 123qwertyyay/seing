SEING v 0.1

SEING is a C/C++ package for fingerprint calculations suitable for machine learning studies 
of molecular systems. 

Fingerprints (in this context) are numerical representations of chemical environment designed 
to be invariant under property-perseving operations such as permutation of atoms of the same 
nature, geometric rotation, etc.

"SEING" is an old French word for signature.
