This folder has the preprocessed data according to the Behler method as described 
in this paper:


The dataset is split into 9 different subsets based on the nature of the atom
(Indium, Gallium or Arsenic) onto which the force is being applied
and also the component of the force that we want to predict (Fx, Fy and Fz).

The last column in each file contains the response of interest (Fx, Fy or Fz).

Please note that the features are also generated differently based on the component 
of the force that we want to predict (essentially, the derivatives of the features 
are taken respectively wrt to dx, dy).

One possibility is to treat the entire dataset into a big one by adding a categorical
feature for atom type, and combining derivatives in all 3 direction into one big feature 
vector and perform multi-output regression to predict all 3 components of the force
at the same time.
